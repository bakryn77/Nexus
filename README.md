Nexus (V0.5)

Nexus is the foundation of my personal AI database—handling knowledge capture, research ingestion, and future RAG-based retrieval.

This version (V0.5) includes:

The Knowledge Manager: a local system for creating, storing, viewing, searching, and deleting notes stored as plain .txt files

The first version of Helix, a lightweight RAG engine that builds vector indexes and enables basic AI-style search

A research bot is going to be the next feature for V1.0
